# MODEL ARGS:
# for model server / sampling args, you can put them under MODEL to be shared, 
# or under the specific pipeline steps (SETTING/ENTITY/etc) for specific options. unspecified sampling args will inherit from the ancestor.
# the format is the same as the openai API, since VLLM also provides and openai-style API.

defaults:
  premise_path: output/premise.json
  output_path: output/plan.json
  logging_level: info # debug, info, warning, error, critical
  MODEL:
    engine: TODO # TODO path/to/vllm-supported/hf/model, vllm-supported huggingface model string, or openai model string
    server_type: vllm # "vllm" or "openai"
    host: http://localhost # model server if using vllm
    port: 9741
    prompt_format: llama2-chat # "none" (pretrained base model), "openai-chat", or "llama2-chat"; add other options in llm.py as needed

      context: ancestors-with-siblings-children # how much context the model sees when generating new outline nodes. options are ancestors, ancestors-with-siblings, ancestors-with-siblings-children, full. you should probably use more context as your model's context window allows.
