# MODEL ARGS:
# for model server / sampling args, you can put them under MODEL to be shared,
# or under the specific pipeline steps (TITLE / PREMISE) for specific options. unspecified sampling args will inherit from the ancestor.
# the format is the same as the openai API, since VLLM also provides and openai-style API.

    host: http://localhost # model server if using vllm
